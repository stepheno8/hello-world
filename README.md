# hello-world
Good day everybody! Steve Walsh here, I just wanted to take a minute to thank all of you for what you are doing and also to help me achieve my life long goals of being able to create programs of my design. 
A little about me, I was born and raised in Cape Town, South African but am of Irish and Dutch descent. I moved to the United States about 14 years ago and never looked backed.
I look foward to working with you and I know that together we'll create and build a better future for all.
Thank you.
